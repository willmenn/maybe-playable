# Java Chess implementation


**WIP**

________

To be implemented:

- Check-Mate Func
- When the Pawn reaches to the end of the board the player can change the piece to any other.

OBS: The idea is to put this two func inside the Board class so that the Main class will orchestrate the game.

WIP:

- Queen func
- King func
- Bishop func
