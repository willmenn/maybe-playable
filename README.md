# Java Chess implementation


**WIP**

________

To be implemented:

- When the Pawn reaches to the end of the board the player can change the piece to any other.
- Castling Func
- Pawn en Passant

OBS: The idea is to put this two func inside the Board class so that the Main class will orchestrate the game.

Nice to have:

- [FEN](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Forsyth-Edwards), but needs Castling and en passant implemented.
